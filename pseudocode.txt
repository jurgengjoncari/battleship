we have two grids with given dimensions
we have 5 ships for each grid

at the beginning of the game, each ship is placed in their grid

every board in the grid is either free or occupied. 
each occupied grid is either hit or not. 

every grid can attack the other grid by choosing a free board one after the other

if all the occupied boards of a grid are hit, this grid is loser. if the same is for the other grid to, then game is a draw, else, this is the winner. 

to place a boat, one can set its front and end positions, to us it doesn't matter though, or a start point and a direction. But i think the first one is more precise. but the second one is a better idea because it doesn't allow you to set the rear outside the boat's length. 

=====
In simple terms, here are two grids against each-other, each of which has some occupied spaces. 
The grids take turns to choose a space from the opponent.
Whichever guesses all the occupied spaces first, wins. 

The setup of the game is each grid deciding their occupied positions.
